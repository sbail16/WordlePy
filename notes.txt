Building a Wordle game with an interactive GUI in Python is a great project idea! Here are some general steps you might consider:

Define your classes: You might have a Game class to manage the game state, a Word class to represent the secret word and its properties,
and a Player class to represent the player and their actions.

Design your GUI: You could use a library like Tkinter to create the GUI. You'll need input fields for the player's guesses, areas to
display the game state, and buttons to submit guesses or start a new game.

Implement game logic: This includes checking if a guess is correct, updating the game state after each guess, and determining when the game is over.

Connect the GUI and game logic: Your GUI should update to reflect changes in the game state, and user actions in the GUI should trigger the
appropriate methods in your game classes.

Remember, it's important to start small and test each part of your program as you build it. You might start by implementing the game
logic without the GUI, and then add the GUI once the game logic is working correctly. Good luck!
